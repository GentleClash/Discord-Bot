# Discord Bot with Chat, Reminders, and Music
My first project.

This is a Python-based Discord bot that provides chat, reminders, and music functionalities. The bot is built using the OpenAI GPT-3 API for chat responses and allows users to set reminders and play, pause, and skip songs from YouTube.

## Features

- Chat: The bot responds to user messages in the Discord server using the OpenAI GPT-3 API, providing interactive chat-based conversations.
- Reminders: Users can create, delete, and modify reminders by sending a message with the time and date of the reminder in a specific format.
- Music: Users can control music playback on the Discord server by sending commands to play, pause, and skip songs from YouTube.

## Installation

To use the Discord bot, you need to follow these installation steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/GentleClash/Discord-Bot.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up the necessary API keys:
- GPT-3 API: Sign up for an API key from OpenAI and update the `config.py` file with your API key.
- YouTube API: Follow the instructions on the Google Developers Console to create a project, enable the YouTube API, and obtain an API key. Update the `config.py` file with your YouTube API key.

## Usage

To run the Discord bot, execute the following command in your terminal:

`python bot.py`

The bot will connect to your Discord server and start listening for commands. You can use various commands to interact with the bot, such as sending messages for chat, setting reminders, and controlling music playback.
